# Worldsmith
[Worldsmith](https://Worldsmith.net) is an open source worldbuilding Platform: a Unity data framework with template database to create and import history and fantasy settings, and tools to visualize, explore, simulate and gamify them.

This is not an auto-generation system: users shape their world specifically through a database of variables and values for each of their world elements: Locations, Characters, Gods, Items, Creatures, Laws, Factions and Stories.

These elements are brought together and presented as an initricately explorable world through a Unity application. A modular simulation system allows these worlds to be stepped forward in time with economic and social progression.
