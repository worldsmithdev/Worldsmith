# Worldsmith 
[Worldsmith](https://worldsmith.net) is a World Building Platform: a Unity framework with template database to organize and import your world, and tools to visualize, explore, simulate and gamify it.

With a pre-configured but flexible layout and interface, and a data framework that is intuitive and powerful, the application is not only a quick-setup world explorer, but a solid foundation for simulation & game development potential.

This is not an auto-generation tool: users shape their world specifically through a database of variables and values for each of their World Elements: Locations, Characters, Gods, Items, Creatures, Laws, Factions and Stories.

## Current State
This current build is early-stage and experimental, with different tools and systems for data input and visualization, but limited executable functionality.
Development focus is now on deeper functionality of my own world, and a MVP template product with better interface. Once these are sufficiently progressed, I will update this core build and description.

## Getting Started
Every step from installing Unity to filling your database to customizing features is described in the tutorials below.
