# Worldsmith
Worldsmith is a World Building Platform: a Unity framework with template database to organize and import your world, and tools to visualize, explore, simulate and gamify it.

With a pre-configured but flexible layout and interface, and a data framework that is intuitive and powerful, the application is not only a quick-setup world explorer, but a solid foundation for simulation & game development potential.

This is not an auto-generation tool: users shape their world specifically through a database of variables and values for each of their World Elements: Locations, Characters, Gods, Items, Creatures, Laws, Factions and Stories.

It is not yet a quick-input, easy-output system; standalone software for this purpose is a desirable, but long-term goal.

This is a collaborative world building platform: allowing people not only to work together on the worlds they want to model; but to contribute to shaping and reshaping the core of the Â platform itself.

## Getting Started
Every step from installing Unity to filling your database to customizing features is described in the tutorials below.

Grab the latest build with full tutorial for free at [itch.io](https://worldsmith.itch.io/), or download / clone the master branch directly.


## Contributing
Join and support the community at the [Subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldsmith/) or [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/YXjSpZF).

The nature of the project dictates that development takes place in a project with your own specific world, whereas the master branch is intended to stay empty-slate, ready for other worlds. 

As such, you'll want to fork or directly download the project to work and develop in. Any tools or features you create for your own project and world, and that you think could contribute to the master branch, you can later recreate and pull request through a new branch.
